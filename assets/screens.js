After the outbreak is cleared up, you struggle to find your place amongst normal human society. Your tall and intimidating form scares most people, and to be honest, you find normal humans to be weak and pathetic and annoying. You can\'t help but think about how massive and strong and sexy you are. About how they should be serving you, and obeying you. You find yourself starting to disdain normal human social practices. You eat your meat raw. You stop wearing shirts and shoes, then pants. Finally you even begin walking around naked. No one calls you out on it, they\'re too afraid of the big powerful wolf. It makes you feel good when you smell their fear. One day you\'re buying some raw steak at the store and you just can\'t take the human inferiority anymore. You order the shopkeeper to give it to you for free, then come around and blow your massive wolf dick. The human is surprised when he finds himself doing it. As you shove your enormous cock into his mouth, your long muzzle stretches into a wicked grin. That is just the beginning of your total control of the neighbourhood. Anything you want, it\'s just a matter of lifting your furry pits and watching your prey become zonked out and obedient. People go from being shocked by your nudity, to turned on by it. Everyone wants to obey the leader of the pack. You have slaves begging to have you use their houses as your lair, and treat them like fuck toys. You take plenty of them up on it, breeding their asses roughly and reminding them that they\'re good for nothing except making a wolf feel good. This is where you belong.",

You can\'t help but fantasise about forcing humans to worship your long paws, or licking their own smooth adorable feet. The lust it gives you makes it impossible to hold down a job. You worry that you will end up on the streets...until you start to get a lot of replies online, on the sites where you habitually post photos of your paws. It turns out there\'s a lot of humans who love following you, and many of them will even pay for special treatment. Your ego swells as you post more photos, telling your many fans that they are your eager obedient bitches. Wiggling your toes on the camera and knowing that hundreds of horny humans are orgasming from the thought of being your paw slaves. The money that they send you to prove their obedience gives you a very luxurious lifestyle, that allows you to fly out all over the world, stomping on obedient slut\'s faces and getting the worship you deserve. It\'s good to be a bunny!",
			"fox": "You escape the hotel, and feel your skin tingling as you escape the cloud of transforming nanites that fill the hotel halls. Your shifting mutations settle on the strongest one, and your body shifts into that of a slender fluffy fox man. After the outbreak is cleared up, you struggle to find your place amongst normal human society. Your furry new body is strange to others, but also oddly alluring. People often stop to photograph you or want to pet you. Eventually you use this popularity to gain access to a famous movie director. At first he\'s dismissive...until you use your sultry, irresistable sex appeal to make him drool and whimper and fall to his knees. As he sucks your cock, and his mind succumbs to your allure, you tell him that you are now his newest, biggest star. You quickly become the world\'s first fox-man celebrity and a modern, fuzzy Errol Flynn. Cinemas are sold out as people clamour to look at your beautiful form, not knowing that they\'re being hypnotically entranced. You grow a massive following of completely obsessed fans, all of whom are desperate to service, massage, kiss and pleasure you. You sit in your mansion one day with a few particularly attractive fans servicing your cock, and grin as you know this is where you belong.",
			"rat": "You escape the hotel, and feel your skin tingling as you escape the cloud of transforming nanites that fill the hotel halls. Your shifting mutations settle on the strongest one, and your body shifts into that of a short, scrawny rat man. After the outbreak is cleared up, you find yourself something of an outcast as a rat-person in the world of humans. No one respects you, and people think you\'re dirty and creepy. It fills you with anger and resentment at humanity. Don\'t they realise that rats are beautiful, proud animals? One day someone insults you in the street, and your anger flares. Somehow, some strange new power seems to flow inside you. You find yourself muttering \'Get him\'. Suddenly, rats surge from every storm drain and gutter, swarming the terrified human. Their little teeth and claws tear his clothes off, and leave him naked and whimpering at your feet. You grin a big buck-toothed smile. You shove your foot down on his chest, and look around at the confused humans around you. Now they will see who is truly inferior! Your reign of terror as the supervillainous Rat King gives you joy you\'ve never felt before. You make a hideout in the sewers with your army of loyal rats, and spend your time finding and recruiting other rat-form survivors. You form a new civilization underground, where they worship their saviour and treat you like royalty. As some of your rat brethren nuzzle your balls and worship your body one day, you think back on the many changes in your life. This is definitely where you belong.",
			"bear": 'You escape the hotel, and feel your skin tingling as you escape the cloud of transforming nanites that fill the hotel halls. Your shifting mutations settle on the strongest one, and your body shifts into that of a massive, hairy bear. After the outbreak is cleared up, you no longer seem to care about fitting into normal society. Your new body has come with a new mindset. All you want is to show off your massive hairy body with some sexy leather gear, and find yourself some nice submissive chubby bears. With the outbreak contained, your body doesn\'t spread the bear corruption, but that doesn\'t change the hypnotic effect of your smell. You discover this quite quickly when you attend a \'bear\' bar and lift your armpits, only to have every guy in the room turn and stare at you with obvious desire. You quickly become a popular feature at your local leather bars, as anyone you shove against your musky pits or chest becomes irresistably attracted to you. It\'s easy to take them home and cover them in bondage gear, before you force them to lick your balls, or take them for a ride on your enormous cock. Once they do, they\'re yours forever. No one can escape their addiction to your musk, and whatever their former lives, all they want now is to be daddy\'s pups and bears. You have all the obedient sexy men you can handle, and plenty of donations of whips, chains and shackles, for you to play with your new dominant and aggressive sexual desires.',
			"boar": 'You escape the hotel, and feel your skin tingling as you escape the cloud of transforming nanites that fill the hotel halls. Your shifting mutations settle on the strongest one, and your body shifts into that of a fat, furry boar. After the outbreak is cleared up, you struggle to fit into normal society. Your endless appetite means it\'s hard to focus on anything but tasty food. One day you\'re gushing about all the brilliant touches that a chef has put into the restaurant meal you\'re eating, when a newspaper editor overhears you. He\'s blown away by your eloquence and clear love and expertise on food. You end up getting a job as a food critic at your new friend\'s paper. Your unusual body makes for a great gimmick to get readers, and your endless love of food makes your articles really fun to read. Your relationship with the editor grows too. He\'s not just impressed by your writings, but also by your enormous, handsome body. He loves to worship your belly and rub and jiggle your huge gut. Especially while you slowly savour some nice food, and have him between your legs sucking on your thick boar meat. It\'s pretty handy when your boss is also your slave. Not to mention that your newfound fame comes with a whole lot of fans who like to visit you with food and treats. Whether or not they came with ulterior motives, somehow they always end up in your bedroom, servicing you with both food and blowjobs. This new life may not be what you ever expected, but it feels right to be a fat happy boar.',

You feel muscles growing under your skin, as it becomes hard strong scales. You spread your wings, and feel your enormous horns thicken and grow. You are an unstoppable dragon! The concrete cracks under your weight as you grow bigger and stronger. You realise you don\'t want them to control this outbreak. You want to be the one in control! The corruption has changed your mind and made you realise that you are superior to all human weaklings. You fly up into the air and conceal yourself atop a skyscraper while the response team contains the outbreak. You\'re not going to let them weaken your new gifts. In the dead of night, when they think everything is under control, you start to pick off the responders one by one. A swipe of your unstoppable claws easily tears their hazmat suits, and then your corruptive breath burns away their minds as they shrink into small, scaly reptiles. One by one, they each become your mindless obedient kobold slaves. You use your new minions to infiltrate the response team headquarters and destroy their equipment. You stand in the burning ruins of their base, surrounded by your slaves, knowing that you are now the only full-powered mutant and there is no one left who can control you. Soon, the entire world will belong to you!',

Glowing, sizzling blue drool drips from your mouth. You can feel something happening to your insides. They\'re becoming hard and crackling and shifting. Clanking and whirring as your flesh and blood is forcefully converted into steel and plastic. Your skin stiffens and hardens, becoming shiny black metal plates. They crack at the edges, and you see under your own skin, at the whirring gleaming machinery inside. Your whole body is being replaced by electronics! You try to speak, but your voice catches in your throat. Your feet stretch and lengthen, as your toes harden into mechanical claws. You rise up onto your toes, your stance shifting. Behind you, your tailbone clanks and grows, forming segments as it becomes a robotic pointed tail. Black metal plates cover your chest and arms, leaving you looking muscular and intimidating. Then the plates start to form over your head, as well. You struggle against them as they trap your head inside a firm, tight black helmet. You feel new ears forming on the outside, becoming tall pointed black mechanical ones. Your face gleams as it becomes just a smooth black glass visor. Your new helmet head is pointed at the front, and you look like a stylized, sinister black jackal. Your body whirrs as you feel your heart stop beating, and instead become a powerful electric engine. With your entire body now a machine, you fight desperately to keep your mind intact. The virus is too powerful, though. Your emotional state is slowly fading. You struggle to hold onto your fear and desperation. It is simply illogical. Your shaking and struggling stops as you stand up straight and still. Your mind feels cold and heartless, as your soft squishy brain is replaced with perfect, flawless circuits and computer code. For a moment, you go still, as you process your new mind. Then you look around, taking in information with your sensory visor. It seems that your mutagenic effect is already rapidly converting this building. Excellent. Many animals and beasts can be sensed all around you. You need to spread the virus further, of course. The entire world must come under the rule of its perfect emotionless cyber anubis ruler. You ARE the mutagen, now. And it is time to take control!'
